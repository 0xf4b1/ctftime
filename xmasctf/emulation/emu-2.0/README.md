# Emu 2.0

## emulation - Points: 50

> Hey! We have found this old cartridge under a desk in the library of Lapland. It appears to be for a system called "Emu 2.0", made back in 1978. These systems don't get produced anymore, and we can't seem to find anyone that owns one.

## Solution

Write an emulator according to the given documentation and execute the rom file. If it works correctly, it will print out the flag. My emulator written in python can be found [here](sol.py).

flag: `X-MAS{S4nt4_U5e5_An_Emu_2.0_M4ch1n3}`
